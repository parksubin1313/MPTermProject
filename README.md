## Motivation
* It is said that the energy wasted by food waste is very high. <br>
* We found that the proportion of food thrown away after the expiration date was high among food waste, and my group thought it would be good to create a service that manages the expiration date of products in the refrigerator. <br>
* Through this service function, not only food waste can be reduced but also inefficient product consumption can be reduced through expiration date management.

## Our Goal
* **_Minimize food waste_** from home through refrigerator management. <br> 
* In particular, we would like to help **_a person living alone_** who have difficulty in managing food through the food sharing function.
